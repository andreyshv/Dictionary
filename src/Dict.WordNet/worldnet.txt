+ lemma
	(index) lower case ASCII text of word or collocation. Collocations are formed by joining individual words with an underscore (_) character.
+ pos
	(n) Syntactic category: n for noun files, v for verb files, a for adjective files, r for adverb files.
+ synset_cnt
	(5) Number of synsets that lemma is in. This is the number of senses of the word in WordNet. See Sense Numbers below for a discussion of how sense numbers are assigned and the order of synset_offset s in the index files.
- p_cnt
	(5) Number of different pointers that lemma has in all synsets containing it.
- ptr_symbol
	(@ ~ #p %p +) A space separated list of p_cnt different types of pointers that lemma has in all synsets containing it. See wninput(5WN) for a list of pointer_symbol s. 
	If all senses of lemma have no pointers, this field is omitted and p_cnt is 0.
- sense_cnt
	(5) Same as synset_cnt above. This is redundant, but the field was preserved for compatibility reasons.
? tagsense_cnt
	(2) Number of senses of lemma that are ranked according to their frequency of occurrence in semantic concordance texts.
+ synset_offset
	(13873264 06652323 06825275 06503777 05575014) Byte offset in data.pos file of a synset containing lemma. Each synset_offset in the list corresponds to a different sense of lemma in WordNet. 
	synset_offset is an 8 digit, zero-filled decimal integer that can be used with fseek(3) to read a synset from the data file. When passed to read_synset(3WN) along with the syntactic category, 
	a data structure containing the parsed synset is returned.

+ synset_offset
	(13873264) Current byte offset in the file represented as an 8 digit decimal integer.
+ lex_filenum
	-> findExample() in SynSet.cs
	(24 - noun.relation - nouns denoting relations between people or things or ideas;
	 10 - noun.communication - nouns denoting communicative processes and contents;
	 08 - noun.body - nouns denoting body parts)
	Two digit decimal integer corresponding to the lexicographer file name containing the synset. See lexnames(5WN) for the list of filenames and their corresponding numbers.
+ ss_type
	(n) One character code indicating the synset type
+ w_cnt
	(01) Two digit hexadecimal integer indicating the number of words in the synset.
+ word
	(index) (outback(a))
	ASCII form of a word as entered in the synset by the lexicographer, with spaces replaced by underscore characters (_).  , 
	in contrast to its form in the corresponding index. pos file, that contains only lower-case forms. In data.adj, a word is followed by a syntactic marker if one 
	was specified in the lexicographer file (markers: p, a, ip). 
	A syntactic marker is appended, in parentheses, onto word without any intervening spaces. See wninput(5WN) for a list of the syntactic markers for adjectives.
+ lex_id	
	-> findExample() in SynSet.cs
	(0) One digit hexadecimal integer that, when appended onto lemma, uniquely identifies a sense within a lexicographer file. lex_id numbers usually start with 0, 
	and are incremented as additional senses of the word are added to the same file, although there is no requirement that the numbers be consecutive or begin with 0. 
	Note that a value of 0 is the default, and therefore is not present in lexicographer files.
p_cnt
	(003) Three digit decimal integer indicating the number of pointers from this synset to other synsets. If p_cnt is 000 the synset has no pointers.
ptr
	(@ 13872501 n 0000
	 + 00704200 v 0101
	 ~ 05128135 n 0000) 
	A pointer from this synset to another. ptr is of the form:
	    pointer_symbol  synset_offset  pos  source/target 
    where synset_offset is the byte offset of the target synset in the data file corresponding to pos.
	The source/target field distinguishes lexical and semantic pointers. It is a four byte field, containing two two-digit hexadecimal integers. 
	The first two digits indicates the word number in the current (source) synset, the last two digits indicate the word number in the target synset. 
	A value of 0000 means that pointer_symbol represents a semantic relation between the current (source) synset and the target synset indicated by synset_offset.
	A lexical relation between two words in different synsets is represented by non-zero values in the source and target word numbers. 
	The first and last two bytes of this field indicate the word numbers in the source and target synsets, respectively, between which the relation holds. 
	Word numbers are assigned to the word fields in a synset, from left to right, beginning with 1.
	See wninput(5WN) for a list of pointer_symbol s, and semantic and lexical pointer classifications.
frames
	In data.verb only, a list of numbers corresponding to the generic verb sentence frames for word s in the synset. frames is of the form:
		f_cnt + f_num  w_num  [ +   f_num  w_num...] 
	where 
		f_cnt a two digit decimal integer indicating the number of generic frames listed, 
		f_num is a two digit decimal integer frame number, 
		w_num is a two digit hexadecimal integer indicating the word in the synset that the frame applies to. As with pointers, 
		if this number is 00, f_num applies to all word s in the synset. If non-zero, it is applicable only to the word indicated. Word numbers are assigned as described for pointers. 
	Each f_num  w_num pair is preceded by a + . See wninput(5WN) for the text of the generic sentence frames.
gloss
	(a numerical scale used to compare variables with one another or with some reference number)
	Each synset contains a gloss. A gloss is represented as a vertical bar (|), followed by a text string that continues until the end of the line. 
	The gloss may contain a definition, one or more example sentences, or both.

Personal Dictionary Trainer
===================

## Goals

Web-based dictionary with ability to create word lists to you want to learn

### Basic functionality similar to [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/)

> Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.

> Anyone who needs to remember things in their daily life can benefit from Anki. Since it is content-agnostic and supports images, audio, videos and scientific markup (via LaTeX), the possibilities are endless.

### What else I want to do
- web dictionary integration
- offline dictionary integration ([WordNet db](https://wordnet.princeton.edu), etc.)
- desktop client app:
  * video player with ability to translate words in subtitles and store it in dictionary; 
  * local dictionary integration (*.dict, *.dsl, etc.)
- sentences/dialogs generator

## What I use
- Backend
  * ASP.NET Core (WebAPI, static files)
  * EntityFramework Core (app db)
  * Newtonsoft JSON (auxillary static db's)
- Frontend
  * Angular2 and plugins (web app)
  * Webpack (development)


## Development Status: Alpha
